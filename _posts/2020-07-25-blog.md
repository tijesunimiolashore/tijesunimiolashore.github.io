Here's my First Blog on Data Science

# Mining Data on Twitter to Identify influencers rank position from Twitter data to help the marketing team of NIKE product plan a new digital campaign in Africa.

Hello Friends…
I am very much excited as this is my first post on Medium. Thanks to God and 10 academy for this wonderful privilege. 
I will be sharing on this blog my response to a challenge I was given in 10 academy to help the marketing team of NIKE shoes who are planning a new digital campaign to identify who the social media influencers are in Africa and in which area fall into (e.g. politics, fashion, art, etc.)
