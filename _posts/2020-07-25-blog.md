# Mining Data on Twitter

### Identify influencers rank position from Twitter data to help the marketing team of NIKE product plan a new digital campaign in Africa.

Hello Friends…

I am very much excited as this is my first post on Medium. Thanks to God and 10 academy for this wonderful privilege.

I will be sharing on this blog my response to a challenge I was given in 10 academy to help the marketing team of NIKE shoes who are planning a new digital campaign to identify who the social media influencers are in Africa and in which area fall into (e.g. politics, fashion, art, etc.)

The marketing team of NIKE shoes wants to think about:
* Could they try to partner with or hire some key influencers to amplify their planned digital campaign?
* How are the influencers endorsed by key government officials?
* Which topics are important for both influencers and key government officials?
In the next few subsections, I will be explaining how I carried out this amazing task:

### Web Scraping
I started by scraping the Twitter handles of top influentials figures and leaders both in the government and non-government. The websites I scraped from are shown below:

[100 Most Influential Twitter Users in Africa](https://africafreak.com/100-most-influential-twitter-users-in-africa)

[African Leaders Response to Coronavirus on Twitter](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/africasource/african-leaders-respond-to-coronavirus-on-twitter/#east-africa)

Like most other sources, these websites ranked the influencers and leaders based on their number of followers and other similar metrics.
